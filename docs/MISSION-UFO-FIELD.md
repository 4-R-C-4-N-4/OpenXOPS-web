# Mission spec: "UFO FIELD" (wave swarm)

Status: implemented and published. PRs #6/#7; live browser verified, 236 tests pass.
Play: https://4-r-c-4-n-4.github.io/OpenXOPS-web/ → ADD-ON MISSIONS → UFO FIELD.
Engine background: docs/ARCHITECTURE.md (the section numbers below refer to it).

## 1. Concept

A UFO has landed in a fenced cow pasture at dusk. Aliens come down its ramp in
three waves. Hay bales and cows are the cover. The player is a rancher with a
scoped lever-action rifle, and can pick up the aliens' laser guns. The mission
is complete when every alien in all three waves is dead.

## 2. Player-facing requirements

| # | Requirement |
|---|---|
| R1 | Simple arena: open field, wooden fence around the edge (too tall to jump), a barn behind the UFO outside the fence, hay bales and cows for cover |
| R2 | The UFO has landed on the far (north) side with a ramp facing the player. Aliens come out of it |
| R3 | 3 waves, each with a different alien and weapon. A banner announces each wave |
| R4 | The mission completes only when all aliens in all three waves are dead |
| R5 | Alien weapons can be picked up from the bodies |
| R6 | The player starts with a scoped lever-action rifle whose damage is in line with the AK47 and AUG, and an empty second slot for alien weapons |
| R7 | Bright, creative colours for alien skins and laser bolts, distinct per weapon |
| R8 | Classic X operations data must load and play exactly as before |

## 3. Engine changes (all additive; classic data unaffected)

### E1. Append weapons (parameter.cpp; TOTAL_PARAMETERINFO_WEAPON 23 → 27)

Stats are modelled on the upstream table (values from parameter.cpp):
AK47 atk 65 / pen 1 / rate 4 / speed 11, AUG 60 / 1 / 5 / 11 with scope 1,
M1 90 / 0 / 8, DE 68 / 1 / 5, P90 42 / 1 / 4, M249 59 / 1 / 4.

| id | name | Based on (hold, flash, model offsets) | atk | pen | blazings (rate) | speed | mag | spread min-max | scope | bolt | sound |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 23 | LEVER 30-30 | M1 rifle hold | 64 | 1 | 9 (lever cycle) | 12 | 8 | 1-14 | 1 (AUG optic) | 0 (normal bullet) | bang3 (M1/DE heavy) |
| 24 | ZAP PISTOL | DE pistol hold | 50 | 0 | 5 | 16 | 12 | 3-22 | 0 | 2 pink | laser1.wav |
| 25 | PHOTON SMG | P90 hold | 40 | 0 | 3 | 16 | 40 | 3-20 | 0 | 3 cyan | laser2.wav |
| 26 | PLASMA RIFLE | M249/M4 hold | 58 | 1 | 4 | 15 | 30 | 3-19 | 0 | 4 lime | laser3.wav |

The laser weapons eject no shell casings. Files go under data/model/weapon/:
lever.x/.bmp, zap.x/.bmp, photon.x/.bmp, plasma.x/.bmp.

### E2. Bolt type per weapon (bullet table, TOTAL_PARAMETERINFO_BULLET 2 → 5)

- New `WeaponParameter.bullettype` field (default 0 = data/model/bullet.x).
  Bullets record it in `ShotWeapon`, and `bullet` rendering picks
  `Resource` bullet model/texture by type.
- Types 2/3/4: data/model/laser.x (an elongated bolt) with
  laser_pink.bmp (#ff2fd6), laser_cyan.bmp (#2ff7ff) and laser_lime.bmp
  (#9dff2f). Type 1 stays the grenade.

### E3. Laser sounds

Add laser1/2/3.wav to the weapon sound list as new sound ids that existing
weapons never use. Existing ids 0-5 and 13 keep their meaning.

### E4. Append human types (TOTAL_PARAMETERINFO_HUMAN 43 → 47, TOTAL_HUMANTEXTURE 30 → 34)

| id | name | texture | hp | AI level | Weapon[0] / [1] |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 43 | RANCHER (player) | rancher.bmp (denim + straw hat band) | 120 | 2 | 23 lever / none |
| 44 | ALIEN DRONE (wave 1) | alien_teal.bmp (teal skin, silver suit, big black eyes) | 80 | 1 | 24 zap |
| 45 | ALIEN TROOPER (wave 2) | alien_violet.bmp (violet skin, orange suit) | 100 | 2 | 25 photon |
| 46 | ALIEN BRUTE (wave 3) | alien_lime.bmp (lime skin, black and gold armour) | 120 | 3 | 26 plasma |

### E5. Waves: held humans + 2 event opcodes (event.cpp reserved slot)

- New point type `POINT_P1TYPE_STAGED_HUMAN = 50`, with the same parameters as
  type 1 (p2 = HUMANINFO point id, p3 = AI path, p4 = identifier = **wave
  group id**). It loads as a held spawn record (not drawn, simulated or
  counted as alive), with its skin preloaded. A human/weapon slot is allocated
  only when deployed. Classic data never uses p1 = 50.
- Event 40, "wait for hostiles": continue only when the number of living,
  enabled humans on a team other than the player's is at most p2.
- Event 41, "deploy wave": enable every held human with p4 == p2, re-init its
  AI, then play a teleport flash + sound at its position. A failed allocation
  stays pending and cannot count as a kill. The event range
  check at event.cpp:274 is extended for 40/41.
- `CheckGameOverorComplete`: completion also requires that **no held humans
  remain**. The order inside one frame (completion check before events) is
  unchanged.

### E6. Limits

MAX_MODEL and MAX_TEXTURE go from 72 to 128 (d3dgraphics.h:49-50): the classic
ZIP plus the 4 new weapons and 3 bolt textures would exceed 72.

## 4. Content

- Mission file: `addon/ufo.mif`, which shows up in the menu's ADDON list
  (AddonList reads `addon/*.mif` through `vfs_list`). Sky 5 (dusk). The one
  addon prop type is the **cow** (cow.x/cow.bmp, decide 9, hp 127, moo.wav). Its back is 22 world units
  tall (player 20). Optional `addon/cow.txt.cover` supplies a rotated body
  hull (`slot halfwidth min_y max_y halflength`: `0 4.5 6 22 11`). Lasers
  stop on the body while it lives; shots above it pass, and dead cows no
  longer block. Without a sidecar, original prop collision is unchanged.
- Map: `data/ufofield/temp.bd1` + `ufo.pd1` + `ufo.msg`, authored as
  `tools/mapgen/examples/ufo_field.json`. Block textures (10 max): grass,
  dirt, hay, fence wood, barn red, barn roof, white trim, UFO hull, UFO
  light, dark interior.
- Layout (world units, player height 20): floor 480×480. Fence on all four
  edges at 24 high (jump apex is well under that). Barn north, outside the
  fence, at about z = -300. UFO centred at about (0, -150): a stacked saucer
  disc made of tapered blocks, legs, a light ring and a ramp descending south
  from the hatch. Player spawns south at (0, 0, 200) facing north. About 10
  hay bales (single and stacked) plus 8 cows scattered across the field.
  Patrol paths fan out from the foot of the ramp.
- Waves: wave 1 = 6 drones (p4 1), wave 2 = 8 troopers (p4 2), wave 3 =
  6 brutes (p4 3). All are held humans at the hatch top. Event line 0:
  wait 5 s → msg "WAVE 1" → deploy 1 → wait hostiles = 0 → wait 4 s →
  msg "WAVE 2" → deploy 2 → wait = 0 → wait 4 s → msg "FINAL WAVE" → deploy 3. Completion is automatic
  (E5).
- Briefing picture: generated from the map JSON (reuse
  tools/artgen/briefing_pictures.py). Briefing text ≤ 14 lines × 52 chars.

## 5. Verification gates

1. Unit/format tests for every new asset (BMP/X/WAV rules), wave and event
   logic in a native harness (staged human not counted; complete only after
   wave 3), map perimeter test (fence closed, no gaps), validate_pack 0 FAIL.
2. Classic regression: original ZIP Training Yard still loads and plays.
3. Browser (test build, QA hooks): mission appears in ADDON list. Briefing
   readable. Wave banners appear, aliens appear at the hatch with colour bolts.
   Pick up an alien weapon. Kill-all hook steps through waves 1→2→3 →
   MISSION COMPLETE only after wave 3. Close-ups of each alien and the
   rifle's scope.
4. Production build has 0 `_qa_` symbols. PR, CI and deploy, then live check.
