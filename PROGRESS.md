# PROGRESS

Goals: docs/GOALS.md · Engine plan: docs/SCOPE-OF-WORK.md (v0.2) · Data pack: docs/FREE-DATA-PACK.md

| Phase | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Fork + pristine import | done | GitHub fork of xops-mikan/OpenXOPS (README-only upstream; the source lives in SVN/zip). `src/` byte-identical to `1.080-src.zip`, tagged `upstream-1.080`. |
| 0 Repo & toolchain | in progress (branch `phase0`) | P0.1 UTF-8+LF conversion done (round-trip verified). P0.2 CMake native build with stub platform builds with gcc 16 and clang 22 under ASan/UBSan and exits cleanly. P0.3–P0.5 and CI not started. |
| 1 Native Linux port | not started | |
| 2 Emscripten target | not started | |
| 3 Web shell & data onboarding | not started | |
| 4 CI & GitHub Pages | not started | |
| 5 QA & polish | not started | |
| FDP manifest + validator | not started | |
| FDP art pipeline (Codex) | not started | Codex image gen smoke-tested OK (1254² PNG, ~60 s, seamless tile). |
| FDP-UI (edit/overlay UI) | not started | part of SOW Phase 3 |

## Decisions log
- 2026-10-17: "Online player" = browser-playable single-player at a URL. Multiplayer deferred (SOW §11).
- 2026-10-17: XOPS data is user-supplied (`xops096.zip`), stored in IndexedDB, and never hosted (SOW §3.1 C-2).
- 2026-10-17: Free Data Pack (CC0) is the default content, so the site hosts free and boots with no upload. BYO xops096.zip becomes an optional overlay. Codex CLI image_generation is the art generator; humans curate.
- 2026-10-17: Non-Windows backend ids are GRAPHIC_ENGINE 9 (GLES), SOUND_ENGINE 3 (OpenAL) and INPUT_INTERFACE 3 (SDL). Windows paths are kept behind `_WIN32` with their defaults unchanged. Key ids stay Windows VK codes (`src/platform/vkcodes.h`).
- 2026-10-17: Source literals are now UTF-8. gcc/clang therefore emit UTF-8 bytes for the Japanese ErrorInfo/log strings. An MSVC build of this tree needs `/utf-8` (or `/source-charset:utf-8 /execution-charset:shift_jis` to keep CP932 output).
- 2026-10-17: Upstream helpers that every backend needs moved verbatim to `src/platform/common.cpp` and `src/platform/input-common.cpp`. A Windows project must add both files.
